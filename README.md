Hi there!

Do people write these in first or third person? Either way doesn't feel quite right...

I'm a former medical student/teaching assistant who's looking to make a change in career. I'm only at the start of my GitHub journey but I'm looking forward to seeing how much I can learn!

pronouns: he/him

Fun fact: slugs can only move forward - I find that inspirational <3
